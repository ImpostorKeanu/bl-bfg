# YAML Examples

This directory contains example YAML configurations that can be consumed
by BFG.

- A complete example against a fake service can be found in
  `attack_full.yml`.
- Examples prefaced with `attack_` are attack-only profiles.
  - If you're about to target Microsoft's Graph API, `attack_ms_graph.yml`
    may interest you :)
- Examples prefixed with `db_values` are profiles used to import values
  into an attack database.
