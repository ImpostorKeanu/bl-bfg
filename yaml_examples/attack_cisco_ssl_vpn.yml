  # ATTACK CONFIGURATIONS
  # =====================
  #
  # This attack configuration is conservative:
  #
  # - Guesses only 1 user at a time
  # - Two passwords for that user
  # - 1-5 seconds rest between guesses
  # - 1.5-2 hour wait between guess rounds
  # - Randomized client ID
  # - Randomized resource URL
